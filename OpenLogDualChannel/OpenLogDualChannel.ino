 Feel free to use, distribute, and sell varients of OpenLog. All we ask is that you include attribution of 'Based on OpenLog by SparkFun'.
 
 OpenLog is based on the work of Bill Greiman and sdfatlib: http://code.google.com/p/sdfatlib/
 
 OpenLog is a simple serial logger based on the ATmega328 running at 16MHz. The ATmega328
 is able to talk to high capacity (larger than 2GB) SD cards. The whole purpose of this
 logger was to create a logger that just powered up and worked. OpenLog ships with an Arduino/Optiboot 
 115200bps serial bootloader running at 16MHz so you can load new firmware with a simple serial
 connection.
 
 OpenLog automatically works with 512MB, 1GB, 2GB, 4GB, 8GB, and 16GB microSD cards. We recommend FAT16 for 2GB and smaller cards. We
 recommend FAT32 for 4GB and larger cards.
 
 OpenLog will run at 115200 baud by default.
 
 During power up, you will see '12<'. '1' indicates the serial connection is established. '2' indicates
 the SD card has been successfully initialized. '<' indicates OpenLog is ready to receive serial characters.
 
 Recording constant 115200bps datastreams are supported. Throw it everything you've got! To acheive this maximum record rate, please use the
 SD card formatter from : http://www.sdcard.org/consumers/formatter/. The fewer files on the card, the faster OpenLog is able to begin logging.
 200 files is ok. 2GB worth of music and pictures is not.
 
 Please note: The preloaded Optiboot serial bootloader is 0.5k, and begins at 0x7E00 (32,256). If the code is
 larger than 32,256 bytes, you will get verification errors during serial bootloading.
 
 STAT1 LED is sitting on PD5 (Arduino D5) - toggles when character is received
 STAT2 LED is sitting on PB5 (Arduino D13) - toggles when SPI writes happen
 
 LED Flashing errors @ 2Hz:
 No SD card - 3 blinks
 
 OpenLog regularly shuts down to conserve power. If after 0.5 seconds no characters are received, OpenLog will record any unsaved characters
 and go to sleep. OpenLog will automatically wake up and continue logging the instant a new character is received.
 
 1.55mA idle
 15mA actively writing
 
 Input voltage on VCC can be 3.3 to 12V. Input voltage on RX-I pin must not exceed 6V. Output voltage on
 TX-O pin will not be greater than 3.3V. This may cause problems with some systems - for example if your
 attached microcontroller requires 4V minimum for serial communication (this is rare).
 
 v3 Blackbox edition
 
 This version has been modified for use with the Blackbox feature for Baseflight / Cleanflight. This version 
 removes useless settings from CONFIG.TXT and changes the default baud rate to 115200.

 Dual Channel edition
 1. Record two channels, can store it into one SDCARD. 
 2. can be configured as mark channel 1 and 2, channle 1 is hardware serial port, the channel 2 is software serial port. 
 3. Using IO6(TX) and IO8(RX) as soft serial port.
 4. 115200 is working. But there is some crashing in bytes due to the soft serial. do not suggest for higher baudrate for dual channel. 
 5. Buffer size is 128 bytes.
 6. 10 bytes time out for recording from buffer to SD card.
